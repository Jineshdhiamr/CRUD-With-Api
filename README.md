## Features:
- **Create**: Users can add new items to the database via API calls.
- **Read**: Retrieve existing data from the backend and display it within the app.
- **Update**: Allow users to modify existing data by sending update requests to the API.
- **Delete**: Provide functionality to remove items from the database using API delete requests.

## Technology Stack:
- **Kotlin**: Utilized Kotlin programming language for Android app development, benefiting from its concise syntax and enhanced features.
- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is used for handling API calls, simplifying the process of sending and receiving HTTP requests.
- **Android Architecture Components**: Employed various components such as ViewModel, LiveData, and Room for efficient data management and UI updates.
- **RecyclerView**: Utilized RecyclerView for displaying dynamic lists efficiently, enhancing the user experience.
- **Material Design**: Followed Material Design guidelines for creating a modern and intuitive user interface.
